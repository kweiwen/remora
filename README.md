### Requirements

- Hardware:
  - Evaluation Board (EVB)
  - Emulator
  - USB-UART Adapter

- Software:
  - CrossCore Embedded Studio (CCES)
  - Visual Studio

### Overview

This project utilizes an Evaluation Board (EVB) purchased from Alibaba at a cost of $60. The EVB is equipped with high-quality audio components, including an ADC-PCM1804 and a DAC-PCM1798, ensuring high fidelity quality.

An emulator, crucial for programming the EVB, was also sourced from Alibaba. This un-authorized unit, priced at $200, provides a cost-effective alternative to the official emulator, which is priced around $2,000.

Additionally, a USB-UART adapter was adopted for serial communication purposes. Priced at approximately $5, this adapter underscores our commitment to cost-efficiency without compromising on performance.

Overall, this setup offers an affordable and robust solution for developing high-quality audio DSP solutions in 2021.
